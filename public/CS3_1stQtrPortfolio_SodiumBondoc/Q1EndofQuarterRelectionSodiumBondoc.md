<h2> End of Q1 Reflection submitted by Bell Bondoc of 9Sodium </h2>

<p>List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.</p>

<li> I find operations very easy. They just need to use arithmetic operators such as +, -, ?, *, and %. These are very straightforward and easily discernable. They also follow the order of operations. </li>
<li> I also understand if-then statements well. They are simple in format as they only usually need three terms, if, else if, and else. The switch statements are also a more concise way of writing lengthy if-then statements. </li>
<li> Declaring variables in Javascript is also very easy as they are used in every project. Javascript is also lenient with the types of variables declared as strings, numbers, and other values can be all used in "let" compared to C++ needing different declaration statements. It can also find the same value of numbers if it is in a string or an actual number value. </li>
<li> I have also mastered typing basic markdown code. It is very useful, especially for making simple websites. </li>
<li> I also know how to operate loops well since they were a major topic for CS 2 last schoolyear. I know how the for, while, and do-while loops work and how they can be used to simplify a code. </li>
<p></p>


<p> List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. </p>

<li> I find boolean operations somewhat confusing as there are multiple rules, especially && and || and TRUE/FALSE values. </li>
<li> I also think that I was not able to master how exactly input statements and IDs work in html as they are quite lengthy and I have not practiced much or looked further into how they work.</li>
<li> I think I also need to study further on how input in Java script works since I haven't understood how process.stdin does its job in the code. </li>
<li> I also haven't studied well on how functions work and how they return values. </li>
<li> Lastly, I should practice debugging as I was struggling to understand the objective of the 7th Graded Excercise. </li>
<p></p>

<p>Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items. </p>

<li> To further understand these topics, I would go on coding websites and study how they work and how to write them. I would also try to create projects for myself that utilize these topics. Furthermore, if I have the time, I might also schedule consultations for any topics I struggle with.</li>

<p> In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why? </p>

<p>Effective :</p>
<li> Q1 3rd Graded Exercise (Guessing Game) on JS IO Statements: - gave us plenty of the JS basics </li>
<li> The Inverted Triangle Bonus Activity - made us think for ourselves and taught us how to code trace </li>

<p>Ineffective :</p>
<li> The Buwan ng Wika Activity - I didn't see how it taught us about html or javascript </li>
<li> 7th Graded Excercise - pre-declared functions were not discussed as much as well as the operations. The code seemed overwhelming and confusing. </li>
