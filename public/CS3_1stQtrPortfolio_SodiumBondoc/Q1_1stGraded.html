  <h1 style="color:maroon;">My Introduction</h1>

    <li>Nationality: Filipino</li>
    <li>Birthday: Feb 18</li>


  <h3 style="color:maroon;">Likes :</h3>

    <li>Drawing people <em>(especially irl, so don't be surprised if you wind up in my notebooks)</em> I really enjoy stylizing faces. Scribbling on paper destresses me.</li>
    <li>Reading <em>(fiction or not, I'm not picky)</em></li>
    <li>US History <em>(Especially about AmRev and Antebellum Era)</em></li>
    <li>Crocheting <em>(I hope I get one of my unfinished projects done)</em></li>
    <li>Listening to music <em>(It helps raise my energy and creativity)</em> specifically MUSICALS <em>(Hamilton, Heathers, Mean Girls, BBAJ, Beetlejuice, yeah)</em></li>
    <li>Physics <em>(Still new to it, so I don't know much, but I am willing to learn more. Sorry CS)</em></li>
    <li>Games <em>(Ok, I don't play often, but I still love gaming.)</em> especially Super Mario and Animal Crossing</li>
    <li>Hanging out with my friends! Or just talking to people I can vibe with.</li>
    <li>Learning about anything that catches my eye</li>
    <li>Developing stories in my head <em>(that I may or may not write)</em> or just writing. I'm in love with creative language.</li>


  <h3 style="color:maroon;"></h3>Dislikes :</h3>

    <li>Rude people and haters</li>
    <li>Mundane and tedious tasks <em>(For some reason, I can push through with completing a 2-hour drawing, yet can't answer a 5-minute google form)</em></li>
    <li>Being really emotional <em>(I can provide emotional support, but I'm not the type to handle my own tears well. Oopsies)</em></li>
    <li>AI <em>(I'm looking at you, VS Code Copilot, trying to read me like a book)</em> jokes aside (I wasn't joking), I just don't favor aspect of AI taking away human creativity and skill. Although I find using it for other simple jobs really helpful.</li>


  <h3 style="color:maroon;">Other Stuff to Know About Me :</h3>

    <li>MBTI : ENTJ and the "J" stands for "Jester"
    <li>Yes, that's one of the topics that caught my eye. Also, please don't stereotype me based on this. I'm not mean (-ish). This is is not 16 Personalities.</li>
    <li>I'm what happens if the words "creativity" and "chaos" had a child. <em>(but sometimes my brain just turns off and I can't think of anything)</em></li>
    <li>I have a fluctuating social battery :'D <em>(One day I'm chatting to everyone in the hall, the next, I'm just gonna wish I was home)</em>
    <li>It's a spin-the-the wheel situation everyday. But even if I'm not in the mood to talk, I would still enjoy listening.</li>
    <li>I stay up at the most random times of the day, so if you see me online at 3 AM, don't be surprised. And who knows? I could be productive by 7 am that morning.</li>
    <li>Coffee. It's what runs in my veins next to jokes I wanna crack with my friends. <em>(I swear I'm funny)</em></li>
    <li>I might be kidding my humor is probably broken. All I do is either make lengthy puns, random movements, or just make a joke out of everything and laugh it off.</li>
    <li>I'm aroace! (aromantic + aexual) meaning I don't really get crushes. When I do, it's mostly a platonic one or they're just pretty/cool with fleeting attraction.</li>
    <li>I think frogs are cute.</li>
    <li>I play the guitar! I would play more often if I wasn't traumatized by one of the strings snapping while tuning it.</li>
    <li>I'm tryna learn Dutch (Yes I'm procrastinating on it)
    <li>I'm doing this because a) I'd like to learn a new language, b) A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren">historical figureᵀᴹ</a> I've been researching about for the past few months has Dutch roots</li>
    <li>I mostly use ">:]", ":]", or the clown emoji. Cuz they just vibe with me really well.
